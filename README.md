Theory of Programming Languages
==============================================
This is a repository for my Theory of Programming Languages course

Caesar Cipher Project
==============================================
For this project, we will be writing a program that will:
* allow a user to **encrypt** a string using a caesar cipher
* allow a user to **decrypt** a string using a caesar cipher
* help the user **solve**(break) the cipher

The Functional programming languages that we will be using are:
* Erlang
* Haskell
* LISP
* Scala (in a functional manner)

The Procedural programming languages that we will be using are:
* Cobol
* Fortran
* Pascal
* Scala (in a procedural manner)

Running Programs
==============================================
To run the files in this repository, I recommend using an online IDE such as
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm. This is the website I used
to check most of my code.

NOTES
==============================================
1. For Scala to run properly on this online IDE, copy and paste the commented out code into the text area in the online compiler.
2. Haskell was the only program I had a downloaded compiler for. You can download the compiler I used at https://www.haskell.org/platform/. Once you have downloaded the platform, open up WinGHCi. Click File > load... > browse to file location. After the modules are loaded in, call the functions and watch Haskell work its magic. (e.g. decrypt 5 "This is a test case")
